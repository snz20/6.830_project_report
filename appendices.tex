\section*{Appendix A: Installing Madlib with PostgreSQL}


These instructions have been tested on Ubuntu 12.04 x64. It won't work with Ubuntu 12.04 x32 (MADlib does not have support for Ubuntu 32-bit). Also, MADlib doesn't work with GCC 4.7.*, so since Ubuntu 12.10 ships with GCC 4.7.2 it might be an issue.

~~\\
\# install postgres packages \\
sudo apt-get -y install postgresql-9.1 libpq-dev postgresql-server-dev-9.1 postgresql-plpython-9.1

\# Download madlib from http://madlib.net and copy tar file to server \\
wget https://github.com/madlib/madlib/zipball/v0.5.0
unzip v0.5.0
cd madlib-madlib-5fabd88 

\# Build Madlib \\
sudo apt-get -y install cmake
sudo apt-get -y install m4 gcc-4.6 g++-4.6 g++
./configure
cd build/
make
make doc
make install

\# To connect to the database: \\
sudo su - postgres
psql

\# To add a password to a role: (note: might be more convenient to use a 1-letter password when coding for MADlib as we'll keep having to enter the password each time we reinstall it) \\
postgres=\# alter role postgres with password 'postgres';

\# To register Madlib with the postgres database \\
/usr/local/madlib/bin/madpack -p postgres -c \$USER@\$HOST/postgres install

\# To test your installation you can run the install check procedure: \\
/usr/local/madlib/bin/madpack -p postgres -c \$USER@\$HOST/\$DATABASE install-check
